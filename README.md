# Real-Time-Object-Detection-With-OpenCV
 This project focuses on achieving real-time object detection through a laptop camera or webcam using OpenCV and MobileNetSSD. The objective is to loop through each frame of the video stream, identify objects such as persons, chairs, dogs, etc., and enclose each detection within a bounding box.
