Introduction
Real-Time Object Detection with OpenCV
This project demonstrates real-time object detection using a laptop camera or webcam with OpenCV and the MobileNetSSD deep learning model. It processes each frame of the video stream to detect and classify objects—such as people, chairs, dogs, etc.—and displays them with bounding boxes for easy visualization.
