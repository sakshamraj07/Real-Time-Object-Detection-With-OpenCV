# Real-Time-Object-Detection-With-OpenCV

### Introduction

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using a laptop camera or webcam, powered by OpenCV and the MobileNetSSD deep learning model. It continuously processes each frame from a live video stream, detects objects such as persons, chairs, dogs, and more, and highlights each detection with a bounding box.

You'll also find the setup instructions and basic explanation of how the code works.


### How to run this code?

**Step 1:** Create a directory in your local machine and cd into it

```
mkdir ~/Desktop/opencv_project
cd ~/Desktop/opencv_project
```

**Step 2:** Clone the repository and cd into the folder:

```
https://github.com/sakshamraj07/Real-Time-Object-Detection-With-OpenCV.git
```
**Step 3:** Install all the necessary libraries. I used MacOS for this project. These are some of the libraries I had to install:

```
brew install opencv
pip install opencv-python
pip install opencv-contrib-python
pip install opencv-python-headless
pip install opencv-contrib-python-headless
pip install matplotlib
pip install imutils
```

âœ… Make sure you're using OpenCV 3.3 or newer with the opencv-contrib modules to ensure the DNN (Deep Neural Network) module is available.

**Step 4:** Make sure you have your video devices connected (e.g. Webcam, FaceTime HD Camera, etc.). You can list them by typing this in your terminal

```
system_profiler SPCameraDataType
system_profiler SPCameraDataType | grep "^    [^ ]" | sed "s/    //" | sed "s/://"
```

**Step 5:** To start your video stream and real-time object detection, run the following command:

```
python real_time_object_detection.py --prototxt MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt.txt --model MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel
```

**Step 6:** If you need any help regarding the arguments you pass, try:

```
python real_time_object_detection.py --help
```
